"""Gate 10: the changed dependencies bring no new vulnerability and no forbidden license.

Only the files OSV-Scanner reads (lockfiles, and the manifests it understands) are audited, and
only when one of them changed. The old version is audited from the parent commit's text in a
private copy of the worktree, and what was already there never reproves: a vulnerability counts
per (package, version, advisory), a license per (package, version, license). The forbidden
licenses are the repository's own list (ADR 0024); without one only vulnerabilities are audited.
A tool that cannot run, or a package whose license is unknown, is inconclusive, never a pass.
