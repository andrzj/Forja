"""Gate 10: Semgrep finds nothing new in the files the attempt changed (the ratchet).

Semgrep's own baseline mode needs a clean git tree, and the attempt's work is in the working tree,
so the old version is scanned instead: the parent commit's text of the changed files, in a private
copy of the worktree. A finding is counted per file and rule, so moving code, or renaming the file,
does not make an old finding look new. Without rules the check does not run: the user supplies
them (ADR 0024), and "not applicable" is never a pass.
