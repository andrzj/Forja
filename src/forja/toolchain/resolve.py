"""Makes the tools the Forja installed visible to the processes it launches (ADR 0037).

The folder of each installed tool goes in front of the ``PATH`` the Forja hands to its children;
the user's own ``PATH`` is never changed. A tool that lives in a virtual environment (a wheel)
goes after the rest instead: its folder also holds a ``python``, which must not hide the one the
repository's tests need.
